## Quick start
Here a documentation on how to use the replication material should be provided.

### Getting started

1. Provide step-by-step instruction on how to use this repository, including requirements, and installation / script execution steps.

2. Code snippets should be formatted as follows.
   - `git clone https://github.com/S2-group/template-replication-package`

3. Links to specific folders / files of the repository can be linked in Markdown, for example this is a link to the [src](src/) folder.

## Repository Structure
This is the root directory of the repository. The directory is structured as follows:

    template-replication-package
     .
     |
     |--- src/                             Source code used in the thesis / paper
            |
            |--- libraries/                implementation of the tests for specific libraries
     |--- documentation/                   Further structured documentation of the replication package content
     |
     |--- data/                            Data used in the thesis / paper 
            |
            |--- camnugent/california-housing-prices/     Dataset of housing prices, used for regression tasks  
            |
            |--- yasserh/breast-cancer-dataset            Dataset of breast-cancer classifications, used for classification tasks  
  

Usually, replication packages should include:
* a [src](src/) folder, containing the entirety of the source code used in the study,
* a [data](data/) folder, containing the raw, intermediate, and final data of the study
* if needed, a [documentation](documentation/) folder, where additional information w.r.t. this README is provided. 

In addition, the replication package can include additional data/results (in form of raw data, tables, and/or diagrams) which were not included in the study manuscript.

## Replication package naming convention
The final name of this repository, as appearing in the published article, should be formatted according to the following naming convention:
`<short conference/journal name>-<yyyy>-<semantic word>-<semantic word>-rep-pkg`

For example, the repository of a research published at the International conference on ICT for Sustainability (ICT4S) in 2022, which investigates cloud tactics would be named `ICT4S-2022-cloud-tactics-rep-pkg`
